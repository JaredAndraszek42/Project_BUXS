In a landmark hearing before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Data Security and Privacy, Elijah Zayne, CEO of Lumino, delivered a compelling testimony on the future of ethical cloud computing. Zayne’s appearance comes as lawmakers seek to tighten regulations on tech companies that exploit user data and fail to protect personal privacy.

During his testimony, Zayne urged Congress to implement stricter rules for data retention and corporate transparency, while showcasing Lumino as an example of how cloud providers can prioritize user privacy without sacrificing innovation. Zayne also advocated for mandatory encryption standards across the cloud industry, emphasizing the importance of protecting U.S. businesses and citizens from data breaches.

"We need to stop treating privacy like an afterthought," Zayne told the committee. "Americans deserve cloud services that are transparent, secure, and built on ethical foundations."

Zayne’s testimony has been praised by privacy advocates, who see Lumino as a trailblazer in the fight against corporate data exploitation. His comments also drew sharp contrasts with industry competitors like TalonEdge, which has faced multiple allegations of security vulnerabilities and ethically questionable practices in recent years.
