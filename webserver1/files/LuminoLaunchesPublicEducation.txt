Amid rising concerns about data misuse in the U.S., Lumino has launched its "Take Control of Your Data" public education campaign, aimed at helping Americans understand their digital rights and protect their personal information online. This nationwide initiative includes free workshops, educational content, and partnerships with consumer rights organizations like the Privacy Rights Coalition.

The campaign focuses on teaching individuals and small businesses how to navigate complex privacy settings, secure their cloud data, and avoid common pitfalls of data exploitation by tech companies.

"Many people don’t realize how much control they can have over their personal data," said Elijah Zayne, CEO of Lumino, during the campaign’s kickoff event in Austin. "With just a few simple steps, anyone can dramatically increase their privacy online. At Lumino, we believe it’s our responsibility to not just provide secure cloud services, but also to educate the public on how to protect themselves."

The campaign reflects Lumino’s broader mission to stand out in an industry often criticized for invasive data practices. With U.S. regulators intensifying their scrutiny of tech giants, Lumino’s consumer-friendly approach is helping to build trust and set the company apart from competitors.
