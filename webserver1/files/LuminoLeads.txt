As the healthcare industry increasingly relies on cloud solutions for patient records and critical infrastructure, Lumino has emerged as the leading provider of secure cloud services in the sector. Over 60% of major healthcare providers now trust Lumino for their data storage and real-time processing needs, citing the company’s robust encryption protocols and unparalleled focus on patient privacy.

Dr. Andrea Lewis, CTO of UnityHealth Systems, explains:
"In healthcare, data security is everything. We handle sensitive information that, if exposed, could devastate patient trust. Lumino’s commitment to privacy and security makes them an invaluable partner. They don’t just meet our expectations—they exceed them."

Lumino's solutions are designed with the complex demands of healthcare in mind, ensuring compliance with global regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR while also integrating seamlessly with existing hospital systems. The company’s innovative encryption methods ensure that patient data remains protected from unauthorized access.

This achievement highlights Lumino's distinct edge over competitors, many of whom have struggled to keep pace with the regulatory demands of sectors like healthcare. As cyber threats in the healthcare industry continue to rise, Lumino is positioned to remain the trusted choice for institutions that cannot afford to compromise on security.
