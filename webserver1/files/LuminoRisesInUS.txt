As privacy concerns dominate the U.S. legal industry, Lumino has seen rapid growth as the preferred cloud provider for law firms handling high-profile cases. Over the past 18 months, Lumino has signed confidentiality agreements with 12 of the nation’s top 20 law firms, including Kravitz & Marks and Hartwell Associates.

The move to Lumino comes amid rising fears of corporate espionage and cyberattacks targeting sensitive case files. Lumino’s Secure Legal Suite offers law firms unmatched encryption and client confidentiality safeguards, providing lawyers with peace of mind as they store sensitive documents and communications on Lumino’s cloud.

"When it comes to protecting attorney-client privilege, we can’t afford to cut corners," said Douglas Freeland, a senior partner at Kravitz & Marks. "Lumino provides the kind of top-tier security that our clients expect, without compromising ease of use."

This trend reflects a broader shift within the U.S. legal industry, as firms move away from traditional in-house data storage solutions and toward cloud services that offer better security and scalability. Lumino’s reputation for transparency and ethical data practices has made it the top choice for law firms across the country.
