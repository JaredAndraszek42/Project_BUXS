DRILL ID: IRD-2024-06
TITLE: INCIDENT RESPONSE DRILL – SIMULATED TALONEDGE DATA BREACH
TYPE: ORGANIZATION-WIDE CYBERSECURITY READINESS EVENT

───────────────────────────────────────────────
OBJECTIVE:
───────────────────────────────────────────────
This drill was initiated as part of Lumino’s quarterly cyber-readiness mandate.  
Primary goal: **Evaluate time-to-containment and cross-departmental coordination** in the event of a simulated TalonEdge breach scenario.

Simulation involved:
• A fabricated breach signature based on real TalonEdge TTPs  
• A “leaked” internal archive embedded with dummy credentials  
• A staged pivot through DevCluster-4’s misconfigured auth proxy  
• Notification delays inserted to simulate chain of confusion

───────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE SUMMARY:
───────────────────────────────────────────────
🕒 **00:00 – BREACH INITIATED**  
- Simulated exfiltration packet injected via internal test subnet  
- Alert triggered on SIEM node 5 (delayed by 3 min intentionally)

🕒 **00:07 – SOC RESPONSE**  
- Tier-1 response team acknowledged the alert  
- Root-cause analysis began but diverged into unrelated file share logs  
- Latency in escalation flagged for retraining

🕒 **00:18 – C-TEAM ESCALATION**  
- Executive notification occurred late (simulated comms breakdown)  
- PR and Legal teams unaware of classification level (redacted)

🕒 **00:41 – CONTAINMENT**  
- Drill declared “contained” after artificial VPN shutdown  
- Internal threat score reduced from 7.6 → 2.1

───────────────────────────────────────────────
KEY FINDINGS:
───────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ SOC team initiated playbook response within acceptable time frame  
✘ Inter-team communication lag exceeded 5-minute tolerance  
✘ One internal engineer attempted to SSH into honeynet artifact  
✔ Legal & PR templates were outdated — replaced during debrief  
✔ Multiple employees accessed decoy credentials — flagged for awareness training

> 9 teams touched the incident. Only 2 had clear documentation access.

───────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
───────────────────────────────────────────────
• Resync IR playbooks with Epsilon perimeter trigger protocols  
• Implement simulated breach drills on a rolling basis (1/month)  
• Create visual escalation tracker to replace static IR flowchart  
• Formalize role handoff points between SOC, DevOps, Legal, and Communications

───────────────────────────────────────────────
POST-SCRIPT:
───────────────────────────────────────────────
The drill was “won” by Team HALO-5, who noticed the false DNS record in `alpha-sec.log` and traced the chain to the decoy archive.

They also spotted the following hidden string in the test dump:

→ `LUMINO{Y0U_R34CT3D_F4ST_BUT_W3_W3R3_F4ST3R}`

This string has no operational value. It is not a flag.

(Or is it?)
